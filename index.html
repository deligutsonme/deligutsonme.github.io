   <h3 class="description">In today's world, tech access isn't optional, it's expected. But many still don't have reliable devices or internet. That gap is real, and it's holding people back. This site is here to talk about it.</h3>

          <h3>The Problem:</h3>
          <br>
          <p>In many communities, students and workers still struggle to access reliable technology, not because they lack skills or motivation, but because devices and internet access are often expensive or unavailable.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="points-text">
          <h3>The Reality:</h3>
          <br>
          <p>About 30% of K-12 students in the U.S. (that's around 15 to 16 million kids) don't have reliable internet or a device that actually works well enough for online learning. Globally, around 463 million children couldn't access remote learning during school closures, not because they didn't own any device, but because the ones they had weren't powerful enough to support school tasks.</p>

        <div class="points-text">
          <h3>Why it Matters?</h3>
          <br>
          <p>Tech access isn't a luxury. It's a basic need for education, opportunities, and participation in today's world.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="points-text">
          <h3>Possible Solutions:</h3>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Schools, libraries, or community centers lend out chromebooks or tablets for long-term use.</li>
            <li>Local governments or organizations partner with tech companies to provide public Wi-Fi hotspots in underserved areas.</li>
